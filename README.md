## Business Task
The Olympics comprises all the Games from Athens 1986 to Rio 2016. The Olympics is more than just a quadrennial multi-sport world championship. It is a lense through which to understand global history, including shifting geopolitical power dynamics, womenâ€™s empowerment, and the evolving values of society.
